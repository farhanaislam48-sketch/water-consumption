    <h1> Projected NESE Pipeline Surcharge Could Push NYC Utility Costs Even Higher </h1>
    <!-- DEK/SUBHED -->
    <h3> City data shows water and sewer costs rising steadily from 2020 to 2025, with critics warning the NESE pipeline’s projected 3.5% surcharge would further strain households'utility budgets. </h3>

    <!-- STORY STARTS HERE -->
    <p> The Northeast Supply Enhancement (NESE) pipeline—proposed by Williams Companies, a Transco subsidiary—is a long-debated natural gas project designed to boost supply to the New York City region. After multiple permit denials in past years, the pipeline, championed by President Donald Trump, secured key approvals from New York and New Jersey regulators in November 2025, allowing it to move ahead.</p>

    <p>Opponents argue the pipeline deepens reliance on fossil fuels and will raise utility costs for New Yorkers. The $1–2 billion construction cost will be financed by National Grid customers through infrastructure charges, with estimates showing an average increase of about <a href="https://nysfocus.com/2025/11/07/nese-gas-pipeline-approval-hochul-trump-new-york#:~:text=The%20pipeline%20is%20projected%20to,money%20on%20their%20electric%20bills." target="blank">$7.50 per month,</a> or roughly 3.5%, on gas bills for households in New York City and Long Island. During over 15 years, customers would collectively pay an estimated <a href="https://queenseagle.com/all/2025/8/14/controversial-proposed-pipeline-off-queens-coast-could-make-comeback#:~:text=%E2%80%9CNot%20only%20is%20this%20pipeline,the%20company%27s%20commitment%20to%20transparency." target="blank">$200 million annually,</a> totaling more than $3 billion.</p>

    <p>These increases would come on top of a sizable 2025 utility expenses already borne by residents across the city. According to borough-level data from the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Water-Consumption-And-Cost-2013-May-2025-/66be-66yr/about_data" target="blank"> NYC Open Data Water Consumption and Cost (2013–May 2025) dataset,</a> New Yorkers collectively consumed hundreds of millions of gallons of water in 2025 and paid significant related charges. That dataset also shows that water and sewer expenses have climbed steadily over time, even before any new gas-related surcharges take effect.</p>

    <p>A review of citywide annual water and sewer charges illustrates this trend. In May 2025, New Yorkers paid $2,827,512 for water and sewer services. Applying a 3.5% increase—the same projected jump tied to the NESE pipeline surcharge—would raise that total to $2,926,475. Based on the city’s FY 2025–2026 rate of $13.07 per HCF, that spending corresponds to roughly 216,336 HCF of water consumption, rising to 223,908 HCF under the projected increase.</p>

    <p>This pattern holds across recent years. In 2024, water and sewer charges totaled $8,047,751, which would rise to $8,329,423 with a 3.5% increase, reflecting growth from 615,742 HCF to 637,293 HCF. Similar jumps appear in 2023, 2022, 2021, and 2020, demonstrating consistent upward pressure on household utility bills.</p>

    <!-- WRAPUP THE STORY HERE -->
    <p>Critics say the NESE pipeline would lay a long-term gas surcharge on top of these existing water and sewer burdens, raising broader concerns about affordability for households already strained by essential utility expenses. Supporters counter that the project is necessary for regional reliability, but many community groups remain worried about the overall financial impact on working families citywide.</p>
